# FastDL Bot

(Current version: 0.2)

A discord bot written in Python using the discord.py library to allow players to query map download links and shortcuts to both FastDL and resource packs. This bot was written for Zeddy's Zombie Escape server specifically where several players have reported issues of downloading maps. The goal of this project is to allow new players to easily find and download maps directly without having to look for fastDL links.

**Note:** The bot is currently in a WIP state. The core functionality is useable, but try to wait until I make some more QoL changes and updates before using the bot.

## To-Do

- Add autocomplete feature for `/map` command
- Remove the need for `big_map` option in favor of an alternate system where bot automatically stores that information
- Add csv file retrieval to build up database of maps
